# Tower Defense

## Project Overview
A 3D tower defense game developed in Unity using C#, inspired by Brackeys tutorial series.
Players strategically place defensive towers to protect their base from waves of incoming enemies.
This project served as a practical introduction to game development, 3D programming, and object-oriented design principles.

## Current Features
* Strategic tower grid-based placement
* Multiple tower types with basic attack functionality
* Wave-based enemy spawning system for increased difficulty
* Core gameplay loop implementation
* Basic UI elements

## Planned Features
*The following features are currently in development:*
* Unique enemy types
* Unique attack patterns for each tower type
* Resource management system for purchasing and upgrading towers
* Additional UI elements including wave information
* Power-up system for temporary boosts
* Save/load functionality

## Technical Implementation

### Completed
* Basic object pooling for resource management
* Core tower targeting and attack scripts
* Basic enemy AI implementation

### In Progress
* Advanced wave management system using coroutines
* Enhanced event-driven architecture
* Additional visual effects and animations
* Advanced enemy behavior patterns

## Learning Outcomes
* Gained practical experience with Unity's component-based architecture
* Developed understanding of game development principles and patterns
* Enhanced proficiency in C# and OOP design
* Improved problem-solving skills through debugging and feature implementation
* Experienced the iterative development process from concept to playable prototype

## Tools & Technology
* Unity 6
* C#
* Visual Studio
* Git
* Unity's UI System
